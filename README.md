The ``xorg mouse config`` folder contains mouse configuration files for usage with X.org, move these to ``/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`` and restart X server to apply changes.

The ``i3`` folder contains configuration files for the i3 window manager to be moved to ``~/.config/``.

The ``i3status`` folder contains settings for i3status to be moved to ``~/.config/``.

The ``neofetch`` folder contains my custom settings for neofetch to be moved to ``~/.config/``.

The ``xbps.d`` folder contains the XBPS mirrors that work best for me where I live. These should be moved to the corresponding ``/etc/xbps.d`` folder.
