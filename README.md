# installation
``.*rc`` files go in $HOME.

``xorg.conf.d`` goes to ``/etc/X11/``.

``tile-wallpaper.sh`` can be placed anywhere, but read the instructions at the top of the script first.

``lock.sh`` is called from ``.xinitrc`` to lock the screen when the lid is closed.

``config.h`` is used when compiling ``sowm``.

Other files and folders go to ``~/.config/``.
