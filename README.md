welcome to my dotfiles repo!
# installation
files in ``Other Dotfiles`` go in your home directory

files in ``X Config`` go to ``/etc/X11/``

files in ``Shell Scripts`` can be called from anywhere, but make sure to read the comments first!

finally, files in ``.config`` go to your own config directory
